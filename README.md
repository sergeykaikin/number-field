# MATCHESFASHION technical test

## Requirements

* Implement a React component like in the image `/Selector-component-UI.png`
* It should receive the label and the quantity as props and should be able to modify the quantity in the parent component
* It should only allow numbers as value
* It should allow typing a number manually or modifying the selected value by pressing the + or - buttons (+ and - will increase / decrease the value by 1)
* It shouldn't allow negative numbers
* The quantity selected should be also displayed in the parent component in real time (see `QuantityDisplayComponent`)

## Notes
* Make sure the solution is tested and the edge cases are handled
* Don't worry too much about styling it, we're mostly interested in the functionality
* Feel free to add any npm libraries, including styling libraries if you feel it would help
* Feel free to use SCSS or any Styled Components library instead of CSS for the styling
